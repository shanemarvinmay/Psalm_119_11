        "10": "Visit of the Queen of Sheba10When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, which brought honor to the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions.10Lord2She arrived in Jerusalem with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.3Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.4When the queen of Sheba realized how very wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built,5she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the Lord.Lord6She exclaimed to the king, 'Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true!7I didn't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I had not heard the half of it! Your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond what I was told.8How happy your people must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom!9Praise the Lord your God, who delights in you and has placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the Lord's eternal love for Israel, he has made you king so you can rule with justice and righteousness.'LordLord10Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds of gold, great quantities of spices, and precious jewels. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.11(In addition, Hiram's ships brought gold from Ophir, and they also brought rich cargoes of red sandalwood and precious jewels.12The king used the sandalwood to make railings for the Temple of the Lord and the royal palace, and to construct lyres and harps for the musicians. Never before or since has there been such a supply of sandalwood.)Lord13King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for, besides all the customary gifts he had so generously given. Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land.Solomon's Wealth and Splendor14Each year Solomon received about 25 tons of gold.15This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders, all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land.16King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than fifteen pounds.17He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, each weighing nearly four pounds. The king placed these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.18Then the king made a huge throne, decorated with ivory and overlaid with fine gold.19The throne had six steps and a rounded back. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne.20There were also twelve other lions, one standing on each end of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!21All of King Solomon's drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver, for silver was considered worthless in Solomon's day!22The king had a fleet of trading ships of Tarshish that sailed with Hiram's fleet. Once every three years the ships returned, loaded with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.23So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth.24People from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him.25Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.26Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem.27The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.28Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price.29At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver, and horses for 150 pieces of silver. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.Or which was due to the name of the Lord.

Anyone who works on that day must be put to death.Lord3You must not even light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath.'Offerings for the Tabernacle4Then Moses said to the whole community of Israel, 'This is what the Lord has commanded:Lord5Take a sacred offering for the Lord. Let those with generous hearts present the following gifts to the Lord:LordLordgold, silver, and bronze;6blue, purple, and scarlet thread;fine linen and goat hair for cloth;7tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather;acacia wood;8olive oil for the lamps;spices for the anointing oil and the fragrant incense;9onyx stones, and other gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest's chestpiece.10'Come, all of you who are gifted craftsmen.

        "9": "Daniel's Prayer for His People9It was the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede, the son of Ahasuerus, who became king of the Babylonians.92During the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, learned from reading the word of the Lord, as revealed to Jeremiah the prophet, that Jerusalem must lie desolate for seventy years.Lord3So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and fasting. I also wore rough burlap and sprinkled myself with ashes.4I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed:Lord'O Lord, you are a great and awesome God! You always fulfill your covenant and keep your promises of unfailing love to those who love you and obey your commands.5But we have sinned and done wrong. We have rebelled against you and scorned your commands and regulations.6We have refused to listen to your servants the prophets, who spoke on your authority to our kings and princes and ancestors and to all the people of the land.7'Lord, you are in the right; but as you see, our faces are covered with shame. This is true of all of us, including the people of Judah and Jerusalem and all Israel, scattered near and far, wherever you have driven us because of our disloyalty to you.8O Lord, we and our kings, princes, and ancestors are covered with shame because we have sinned against you.Lord9But the Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him.10We have not obeyed the Lord our God, for we have not followed the instructions he gave us through his servants the prophets.Lord11All Israel has disobeyed your instruction and turned away, refusing to listen to your voice.'So now the solemn curses and judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured down on us because of our sin.12You have kept your word and done to us and our rulers exactly as you warned. Never has there been such a disaster as happened in Jerusalem.13Every curse written against us in the Law of Moses has come true. Yet we have refused to seek mercy from the Lord our God by turning from our sins and recognizing his truth.Lord14Therefore, the Lord has brought upon us the disaster he prepared. The Lord our God was right to do all of these things, for we did not obey him.LordLord15'O Lord our God, you brought lasting honor to your name by rescuing your people from Egypt in a great display of power. But we have sinned and are full of wickedness.16In view of all your faithful mercies, Lord, please turn your furious anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. All the neighboring nations mock Jerusalem and your people because of our sins and the sins of our ancestors.17'O our God, hear your servant's prayer! Listen as I plead. For your own sake, Lord, smile again on your desolate sanctuary.18'O my God, lean down and listen to me. Open your eyes and see our despair. See how your city-the city that bears your name-lies in ruins. We make this plea, not because we deserve help, but because of your mercy.19'O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, listen and act! For your own sake, do not delay, O my God, for your people and your city bear your name.'Gabriel's Message about the Anointed One20I went on praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people, pleading with the Lord my God for Jerusalem, his holy mountain.Lord21As I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice.22He explained to me, 'Daniel, I have come here to give you insight and understanding.23The moment you began praying, a command was given. And now I am here to tell you what it was, for you are very precious to God. Listen carefully so that you can understand the meaning of your vision.24'A period of seventy sets of seven has been decreed for your people and your holy city to finish their rebellion, to put an end to their sin, to atone for their guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to confirm the prophetic vision, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.25Now listen and understand! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of seven will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until a ruler-the Anointed One-comes. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses, despite the perilous times.26'After this period of sixty-two sets of seven, the Anointed One will be killed, appearing to have accomplished nothing, and a ruler will arise whose armies will destroy the city and the Temple. The end will come with a flood, and war and its miseries are decreed from that time to the very end.27The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of seven, but after half this time, he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings.

In either case the man is unclean.4Any bed on which the man with the discharge lies and anything on which he sits will be ceremonially unclean.5So if you touch the man's bed, you must wash your clothes and bathe yourself in water, and you will remain unclean until evening.6If you sit where the man with the discharge has sat, you must wash your clothes and bathe yourself in water, and you will remain unclean until evening.7If you touch the man with the discharge, you must wash your clothes and bathe yourself in water, and you will remain unclean until evening.8If the man spits on you, you must wash your clothes and bathe yourself in water, and you will remain unclean until evening.9Any saddle blanket on which the man rides will be ceremonially unclean.10If you touch anything that was under the man, you will be unclean until evening. You must wash your clothes and bathe yourself in water, and you will remain unclean until evening.11If the man touches you without first rinsing his hands, you must wash your clothes and bathe yourself in water, and you will remain unclean until evening.12Any clay pot the man touches must be broken, and any wooden utensil he touches must be rinsed with water.13'When the man with the discharge is healed, he must count off seven days for the period of purification. Then he must wash his clothes and bathe himself in fresh water, and he will be ceremonially clean.14On the eighth day he must get two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle and give his offerings to the priest.Lord15The priest will offer one bird for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

He will remain unclean for seven days, and any bed on which he lies will be unclean.25'If a woman has a flow of blood for many days that is unrelated to her menstrual period, or if the blood continues beyond the normal period, she is ceremonially unclean. As during her menstrual period, the woman will be unclean as long as the discharge continues.26Any bed she lies on and any object she sits on during that time will be unclean, just as during her normal menstrual period.27If any of you touch these things, you will be ceremonially unclean.

        "12": "Nathan Rebukes David12So the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story: 'There were two men in a certain town. One was rich, and one was poor.12Lord2The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle.3The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man's own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter.4One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man's lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest.'5David was furious. 'As surely as the Lord lives,' he vowed, 'any man who would do such a thing deserves to die!Lord6He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity.'7Then Nathan said to David, 'You are that man! The Lord, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul.Lord8I gave you your master's house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more.9Why, then, have you despised the word of the Lord and done this horrible deed? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife.Lord10From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah's wife to be your own.11'This is what the Lord says: Because of what you have done, I will cause your own household to rebel against you. I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes, and he will go to bed with them in public view.Lord12You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel.'David Confesses His Guilt13Then David confessed to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord.'LordNathan replied, 'Yes, but the Lord has forgiven you, and you won't die for this sin.Lord14Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the word of the Lord by doing this, your child will die.'Lord15After Nathan returned to his home, the Lord sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah's wife.Lord16David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground.17The elders of his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he refused.18Then on the seventh day the child died. David's advisers were afraid to tell him. 'He wouldn't listen to reason while the child was ill,' they said. 'What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the child is dead?'19When David saw them whispering, he realized what had happened. 'Is the child dead?' he asked.'Yes,' they replied, 'he is dead.'20Then David got up from the ground, washed himself, put on lotions, and changed his clothes. He went to the Tabernacle and worshiped the Lord. After that, he returned to the palace and was served food and ate.Lord21His advisers were amazed. 'We don't understand you,' they told him. 'While the child was still living, you wept and refused to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning and are eating again.'22David replied, 'I fasted and wept while the child was alive, for I said, 'Perhaps the Lord will be gracious to me and let the child live.'Lord23But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to me.'24Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and David named him Solomon. The Lord loved the childLord25and sent word through Nathan the prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means 'beloved of the Lord'), as the Lord had commanded.LordLordDavid Captures Rabbah26Meanwhile, Joab was fighting against Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, and he captured the royal fortifications.27Joab sent messengers to tell David, 'I have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply.28Now bring the rest of the army and capture the city. Otherwise, I will capture it and get credit for the victory.'29So David gathered the rest of the army and went to Rabbah, and he fought against it and captured it.30David removed the crown from the king's head, and it was placed on his own head. The crown was made of gold and set with gems, and it weighed seventy-five pounds. David took a vast amount of plunder from the city.31He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and to work in the brick kilns. That is how he dealt with the people of all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.As in Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text reads the enemies of the Lord.Lord.Hebrew anointed himself.Hebrew he; an alternate Hebrew reading and some Hebrew manuscripts read she.As in Greek version; Hebrew reads because of the Lord.LordOr the royal city.Or captured the city of water.Or from the head of Milcom (as in Greek version).

        "17": "Goliath Challenges the Israelites17The Philistines now mustered their army for battle and camped between Socoh in Judah and Azekah at Ephes-dammim.172Saul countered by gathering his Israelite troops near the valley of Elah.3So the Philistines and Israelites faced each other on opposite hills, with the valley between them.4Then Goliath, a Philistine champion from Gath, came out of the Philistine ranks to face the forces of Israel. He was over nine feet tall!5He wore a bronze helmet, and his bronze coat of mail weighed 125 pounds.6He also wore bronze leg armor, and he carried a bronze javelin on his shoulder.7The shaft of his spear was as heavy and thick as a weaver's beam, tipped with an iron spearhead that weighed 15 pounds. His armor bearer walked ahead of him carrying a shield.8Goliath stood and shouted a taunt across to the Israelites. 'Why are you all coming out to fight?' he called. 'I am the Philistine champion, but you are only the servants of Saul. Choose one man to come down here and fight me!9If he kills me, then we will be your slaves. But if I kill him, you will be our slaves!10I defy the armies of Israel today! Send me a man who will fight me!'11When Saul and the Israelites heard this, they were terrified and deeply shaken.Jesse Sends David to Saul's Camp12Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in the land of Judah. Jesse was an old man at that time, and he had eight sons.13Jesse's three oldest sons-Eliab, Abinadab, and Shimea-had already joined Saul's army to fight the Philistines.14David was the youngest son. David's three oldest brothers stayed with Saul's army,15but David went back and forth so he could help his father with the sheep in Bethlehem.16For forty days, every morning and evening, the Philistine champion strutted in front of the Israelite army.17One day Jesse said to David, 'Take this basket of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and carry them quickly to your brothers.18And give these ten cuts of cheese to their captain. See how your brothers are getting along, and bring back a report on how they are doing.'19David's brothers were with Saul and the Israelite army at the valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.20So David left the sheep with another shepherd and set out early the next morning with the gifts, as Jesse had directed him. He arrived at the camp just as the Israelite army was leaving for the battlefield with shouts and battle cries.21Soon the Israelite and Philistine forces stood facing each other, army against army.22David left his things with the keeper of supplies and hurried out to the ranks to greet his brothers.23As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, came out from the Philistine ranks. Then David heard him shout his usual taunt to the army of Israel.24As soon as the Israelite army saw him, they began to run away in fright.25'Have you seen the giant?' the men asked. 'He comes out each day to defy Israel. The king has offered a huge reward to anyone who kills him. He will give that man one of his daughters for a wife, and the man's entire family will be exempted from paying taxes!'26David asked the soldiers standing nearby, 'What will a man get for killing this Philistine and ending his defiance of Israel? Who is this pagan Philistine anyway, that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God?'27And these men gave David the same reply. They said, 'Yes, that is the reward for killing him.'28But when David's oldest brother, Eliab, heard David talking to the men, he was angry. 'What are you doing around here anyway?' he demanded. 'What about those few sheep you're supposed to be taking care of? I know about your pride and deceit. You just want to see the battle!'29'What have I done now?' David replied. 'I was only asking a question!'30He walked over to some others and asked them the same thing and received the same answer.31Then David's question was reported to King Saul, and the king sent for him.David Kills Goliath32'Don't worry about this Philistine,' David told Saul. 'I'll go fight him!'33'Don't be ridiculous!' Saul replied. 'There's no way you can fight this Philistine and possibly win! You're only a boy, and he's been a man of war since his youth.'34But David persisted. 'I have been taking care of my father's sheep and goats,' he said. 'When a lion or a bear comes to steal a lamb from the flock,35I go after it with a club and rescue the lamb from its mouth. If the animal turns on me, I catch it by the jaw and club it to death.36I have done this to both lions and bears, and I'll do it to this pagan Philistine, too, for he has defied the armies of the living God!37The Lord who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine!'LordSaul finally consented. 'All right, go ahead,' he said. 'And may the Lord be with you!'Lord38Then Saul gave David his own armor-a bronze helmet and a coat of mail.39David put it on, strapped the sword over it, and took a step or two to see what it was like, for he had never worn such things before.'I can't go in these,' he protested to Saul. 'I'm not used to them.' So David took them off again.40He picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them into his shepherd's bag. Then, armed only with his shepherd's staff and sling, he started across the valley to fight the Philistine.41Goliath walked out toward David with his shield bearer ahead of him,42sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy.43'Am I a dog,' he roared at David, 'that you come at me with a stick?' And he cursed David by the names of his gods.44'Come over here, and I'll give your flesh to the birds and wild animals!' Goliath yelled.45David replied to the Philistine, 'You come to me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of Heaven's Armies-the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.Lord46Today the Lord will conquer you, and I will kill you and cut off your head. And then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds and wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel!Lord47And everyone assembled here will know that the Lord rescues his people, but not with sword and spear. This is the Lord's battle, and he will give you to us!'LordLord48As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him.49Reaching into his shepherd's bag and taking out a stone, he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead. The stone sank in, and Goliath stumbled and fell face down on the ground.50So David triumphed over the Philistine with only a sling and a stone, for he had no sword.51Then David ran over and pulled Goliath's sword from its sheath. David used it to kill him and cut off his head.Israel Routs the PhilistinesWhen the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they turned and ran.52Then the men of Israel and Judah gave a great shout of triumph and rushed after the Philistines, chasing them as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron. The bodies of the dead and wounded Philistines were strewn all along the road from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron.53Then the Israelite army returned and plundered the deserted Philistine camp.54(David took the Philistine's head to Jerusalem, but he stored the man's armor in his own tent.)55As Saul watched David go out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of his army, 'Abner, whose son is this young man?''I really don't know,' Abner declared.56'Well, find out who he is!' the king told him.57As soon as David returned from killing Goliath, Abner brought him to Saul with the Philistine's head still in his hand.58'Tell me about your father, young man,' Saul said.And David replied, 'His name is Jesse, and we live in Bethlehem.'Hebrew 6 cubits and 1 span [which totals about 9.75 feet or 3 meters]; Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version read 4 cubits and 1 span [which totals about 6.75 feet or 2 meters].Hebrew 5,000 shekels [57 kilograms].Hebrew 600 shekels [6.8 kilograms].Hebrew Shammah, a variant spelling of Shimea; compare ; .Hebrew ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters].Hebrew and take their pledge.As in some Greek manuscripts; Hebrew reads a valley."

        "9": "Ezra's Prayer concerning Intermarriage9When these things had been done, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, 'Many of the people of Israel, and even some of the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the other peoples living in the land. They have taken up the detestable practices of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.92For the men of Israel have married women from these people and have taken them as wives for their sons. So the holy race has become polluted by these mixed marriages. Worse yet, the leaders and officials have led the way in this outrage.'3When I heard this, I tore my cloak and my shirt, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down utterly shocked.4Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel came and sat with me because of this outrage committed by the returned exiles. And I sat there utterly appalled until the time of the evening sacrifice.5At the time of the sacrifice, I stood up from where I had sat in mourning with my clothes torn. I fell to my knees and lifted my hands to the Lord my God.Lord6I prayed,'O my God, I am utterly ashamed; I blush to lift up my face to you. For our sins are piled higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached to the heavens.7From the days of our ancestors until now, we have been steeped in sin. That is why we and our kings and our priests have been at the mercy of the pagan kings of the land. We have been killed, captured, robbed, and disgraced, just as we are today.8'But now we have been given a brief moment of grace, for the Lord our God has allowed a few of us to survive as a remnant. He has given us security in this holy place. Our God has brightened our eyes and granted us some relief from our slavery.Lord9For we were slaves, but in his unfailing love our God did not abandon us in our slavery. Instead, he caused the kings of Persia to treat us favorably. He revived us so we could rebuild the Temple of our God and repair its ruins. He has given us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.10'And now, O our God, what can we say after all of this? For once again we have abandoned your commands!11Your servants the prophets warned us when they said, 'The land you are entering to possess is totally defiled by the detestable practices of the people living there. From one end to the other, the land is filled with corruption.12Don't let your daughters marry their sons! Don't take their daughters as wives for your sons. Don't ever promote the peace and prosperity of those nations. If you follow these instructions, you will be strong and will enjoy the good things the land produces, and you will leave this prosperity to your children forever.'13'Now we are being punished because of our wickedness and our great guilt. But we have actually been punished far less than we deserve, for you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive as a remnant.14But even so, we are again breaking your commands and intermarrying with people who do these detestable things. Won't your anger be enough to destroy us, so that even this little remnant no longer survives?15O Lord, God of Israel, you are just. We come before you in our guilt as nothing but an escaped remnant, though in such a condition none of us can stand in your presence.'Lord"

        "19": "The Levite and His Concubine19Now in those days Israel had no king. There was a man from the tribe of Levi living in a remote area of the hill country of Ephraim. One day he brought home a woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine.192But she became angry with him and returned to her father's home in Bethlehem.After about four months,3her husband set out for Bethlehem to speak personally to her and persuade her to come back. He took with him a servant and a pair of donkeys. When he arrived at her father's house, her father saw him and welcomed him.4Her father urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days, eating, drinking, and sleeping there.5On the fourth day the man was up early, ready to leave, but the woman's father said to his son-in-law, 'Have something to eat before you go.'6So the two men sat down together and had something to eat and drink. Then the woman's father said, 'Please stay another night and enjoy yourself.'7The man got up to leave, but his father-in-law kept urging him to stay, so he finally gave in and stayed the night.8On the morning of the fifth day he was up early again, ready to leave, and again the woman's father said, 'Have something to eat; then you can leave later this afternoon.' So they had another day of feasting.9Later, as the man and his concubine and servant were preparing to leave, his father-in-law said, 'Look, it's almost evening. Stay the night and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early and be on your way.'10But this time the man was determined to leave. So he took his two saddled donkeys and his concubine and headed in the direction of Jebus (that is, Jerusalem).11It was late in the day when they neared Jebus, and the man's servant said to him, 'Let's stop at this Jebusite town and spend the night there.'12'No,' his master said, 'we can't stay in this foreign town where there are no Israelites. Instead, we will go on to Gibeah.13Come on, let's try to get as far as Gibeah or Ramah, and we'll spend the night in one of those towns.'14So they went on. The sun was setting as they came to Gibeah, a town in the land of Benjamin,15so they stopped there to spend the night. They rested in the town square, but no one took them in for the night.16That evening an old man came home from his work in the fields. He was from the hill country of Ephraim, but he was living in Gibeah, where the people were from the tribe of Benjamin.17When he saw the travelers sitting in the town square, he asked them where they were from and where they were going.18'We have been in Bethlehem in Judah,' the man replied. 'We are on our way to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim, which is my home. I traveled to Bethlehem, and now I'm returning home. But no one has taken us in for the night,19even though we have everything we need. We have straw and feed for our donkeys and plenty of bread and wine for ourselves.'20'You are welcome to stay with me,' the old man said. 'I will give you anything you might need. But whatever you do, don't spend the night in the square.'21So he took them home with him and fed the donkeys. After they washed their feet, they ate and drank together.22While they were enjoying themselves, a crowd of troublemakers from the town surrounded the house. They began beating at the door and shouting to the old man, 'Bring out the man who is staying with you so we can have sex with him.'23The old man stepped outside to talk to them. 'No, my brothers, don't do such an evil thing. For this man is a guest in my house, and such a thing would be shameful.24Here, take my virgin daughter and this man's concubine. I will bring them out to you, and you can abuse them and do whatever you like. But don't do such a shameful thing to this man.'25But they wouldn't listen to him. So the Levite took hold of his concubine and pushed her out the door. The men of the town abused her all night, taking turns raping her until morning. Finally, at dawn they let her go.26At daybreak the woman returned to the house where her husband was staying. She collapsed at the door of the house and lay there until it was light.27When her husband opened the door to leave, there lay his concubine with her hands on the threshold.28He said, 'Get up! Let's go!' But there was no answer. So he put her body on his donkey and took her home.29When he got home, he took a knife and cut his concubine's body into twelve pieces. Then he sent one piece to each tribe throughout all the territory of Israel.30Everyone who saw it said, 'Such a horrible crime has not been committed in all the time since Israel left Egypt. Think about it! What are we going to do? Who's going to speak up?'Or she was unfaithful to him.As in Greek version; Hebrew reads When she brought him to.As in Greek version (see also ); Hebrew reads now I'm going to the Tabernacle of the Lord.LordGreek version adds for she was dead."

He was sitting on a lofty throne, and the train of his robe filled the Temple.62Attending him were mighty seraphim, each having six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.3They were calling out to each other,'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven's Armies!LordThe whole earth is filled with his glory!'The whole earth is filled with his glory!'4Their voices shook the Temple to its foundations, and the entire building was filled with smoke.5Then I said, 'It's all over!

    "Genesis": {
        "34": "Revenge against Shechem34One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the young women who lived in the area.342But when the local prince, Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, saw Dinah, he seized her and raped her.3But then he fell in love with her, and he tried to win her affection with tender words.4He said to his father, Hamor, 'Get me this young girl. I want to marry her.'5Soon Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter, Dinah. But since his sons were out in the fields herding his livestock, he said nothing until they returned.6Hamor, Shechem's father, came to discuss the matter with Jacob.7Meanwhile, Jacob's sons had come in from the field as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious that their sister had been raped. Shechem had done a disgraceful thing against Jacob's family, something that should never be done.8Hamor tried to speak with Jacob and his sons. 'My son Shechem is truly in love with your daughter,' he said. 'Please let him marry her.9In fact, let's arrange other marriages, too. You give us your daughters for our sons, and we will give you our daughters for your sons.10And you may live among us; the land is open to you! Settle here and trade with us. And feel free to buy property in the area.'11Then Shechem himself spoke to Dinah's father and brothers. 'Please be kind to me, and let me marry her,' he begged. 'I will give you whatever you ask.12No matter what dowry or gift you demand, I will gladly pay it-just give me the girl as my wife.'13But since Shechem had defiled their sister, Dinah, Jacob's sons responded deceitfully to Shechem and his father, Hamor.14They said to them, 'We couldn't possibly allow this, because you're not circumcised. It would be a disgrace for our sister to marry a man like you!15But here is a solution. If every man among you will be circumcised like we are,16then we will give you our daughters, and we'll take your daughters for ourselves. We will live among you and become one people.17But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we will take her and be on our way.'18Hamor and his son Shechem agreed to their proposal.19Shechem wasted no time in acting on this request, for he wanted Jacob's daughter desperately. Shechem was a highly respected member of his family,20and he went with his father, Hamor, to present this proposal to the leaders at the town gate.21'These men are our friends,' they said. 'Let's invite them to live here among us and trade freely. Look, the land is large enough to hold them. We can take their daughters as wives and let them marry ours.22But they will consider staying here and becoming one people with us only if all of our men are circumcised, just as they are.23But if we do this, all their livestock and possessions will eventually be ours. Come, let's agree to their terms and let them settle here among us.'24So all the men in the town council agreed with Hamor and Shechem, and every male in the town was circumcised.25But three days later, when their wounds were still sore, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, who were Dinah's full brothers, took their swords and entered the town without opposition. Then they slaughtered every male there,26including Hamor and his son Shechem. They killed them with their swords, then took Dinah from Shechem's house and returned to their camp.27Meanwhile, the rest of Jacob's sons arrived. Finding the men slaughtered, they plundered the town because their sister had been defiled there.28They seized all the flocks and herds and donkeys-everything they could lay their hands on, both inside the town and outside in the fields.29They looted all their wealth and plundered their houses. They also took all their little children and wives and led them away as captives.30Afterward Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have ruined me! You've made me stink among all the people of this land-among all the Canaanites and Perizzites. We are so few that they will join forces and crush us. I will be ruined, and my entire household will be wiped out!'31'But why should we let him treat our sister like a prostitute?' they retorted angrily.Hebrew a disgraceful thing in Israel."

    "Mark": {
        "6": "Jesus Rejected at Nazareth6Jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown.62The next Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, 'Where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles?'3Then they scoffed, 'He's just a carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon. And his sisters live right here among us.' They were deeply offended and refused to believe in him.4Then Jesus told them, 'A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family.''A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family.'5And because of their unbelief, he couldn't do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them.6And he was amazed at their unbelief.Jesus Sends Out the Twelve DisciplesThen Jesus went from village to village, teaching the people.7And he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two, giving them authority to cast out evil spirits.8He told them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick-no food, no traveler's bag, no money.9He allowed them to wear sandals but not to take a change of clothes.10'Wherever you go,' he said, 'stay in the same house until you leave town.'Wherever you go,''stay in the same house until you leave town.11But if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate.'But if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate.'12So the disciples went out, telling everyone they met to repent of their sins and turn to God.13And they cast out many demons and healed many sick people, anointing them with olive oil.The Death of John the Baptist14Herod Antipas, the king, soon heard about Jesus, because everyone was talking about him. Some were saying, 'This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead. That is why he can do such miracles.'15Others said, 'He's the prophet Elijah.' Still others said, 'He's a prophet like the other great prophets of the past.'16When Herod heard about Jesus, he said, 'John, the man I beheaded, has come back from the dead.'17For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest and imprison John as a favor to Herodias. She had been his brother Philip's wife, but Herod had married her.18John had been telling Herod, 'It is against God's law for you to marry your brother's wife.'19So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But without Herod's approval she was powerless,20for Herod respected John; and knowing that he was a good and holy man, he protected him. Herod was greatly disturbed whenever he talked with John, but even so, he liked to listen to him.21Herodias's chance finally came on Herod's birthday. He gave a party for his high government officials, army officers, and the leading citizens of Galilee.22Then his daughter, also named Herodias, came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased Herod and his guests. 'Ask me for anything you like,' the king said to the girl, 'and I will give it to you.'23He even vowed, 'I will give you whatever you ask, up to half my kingdom!'24She went out and asked her mother, 'What should I ask for?'Her mother told her, 'Ask for the head of John the Baptist!'25So the girl hurried back to the king and told him, 'I want the head of John the Baptist, right now, on a tray!'26Then the king deeply regretted what he had said; but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests, he couldn't refuse her.27So he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off John's head and bring it to him. The soldier beheaded John in the prison,28brought his head on a tray, and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.29When John's disciples heard what had happened, they came to get his body and buried it in a tomb.Jesus Feeds Five Thousand30The apostles returned to Jesus from their ministry tour and told him all they had done and taught.31Then Jesus said, 'Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile.' He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and his apostles didn't even have time to eat.'Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile.'32So they left by boat for a quiet place, where they could be alone.33But many people recognized them and saw them leaving, and people from many towns ran ahead along the shore and got there ahead of them.34Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.35Late in the afternoon his disciples came to him and said, 'This is a remote place, and it's already getting late.36Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat.'37But Jesus said, 'You feed them.''You feed them.''With what?' they asked. 'We'd have to work for months to earn enough money to buy food for all these people!'38'How much bread do you have?' he asked. 'Go and find out.''How much bread do you have?''Go and find out.'They came back and reported, 'We have five loaves of bread and two fish.'39Then Jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass.40So they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred.41Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. He also divided the fish for everyone to share.42They all ate as much as they wanted,43and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish.44A total of 5,000 men and their families were fed.Jesus Walks on Water45Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to Bethsaida, while he sent the people home.46After telling everyone good-bye, he went up into the hills by himself to pray.47Late that night, the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on land.48He saw that they were in serious trouble, rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves. About three o'clock in the morning Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. He intended to go past them,49but when they saw him walking on the water, they cried out in terror, thinking he was a ghost.50They were all terrified when they saw him.But Jesus spoke to them at once. 'Don't be afraid,' he said. 'Take courage! I am here!''Don't be afraid,''Take courage! I am here!'51Then he climbed into the boat, and the wind stopped. They were totally amazed,52for they still didn't understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves. Their hearts were too hard to take it in.53After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret. They brought the boat to shore54and climbed out. The people recognized Jesus at once,55and they ran throughout the whole area, carrying sick people on mats to wherever they heard he was.56Wherever he went-in villages, cities, or the countryside-they brought the sick out to the marketplaces. They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.Some manuscripts read He's just the son of the carpenter and of Mary.Most manuscripts read Joses; see .Greek unclean.Greek no copper coins in their money belts.Some manuscripts read He was saying.Some manuscripts read the daughter of Herodias herself.Greek It would take 200 denarii.

        "9": "Death Comes to All9This, too, I carefully explored: Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God's hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor.92The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad, ceremonially clean or unclean, religious or irreligious. Good people receive the same treatment as sinners, and people who make promises to God are treated like people who don't.3It seems so wrong that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate. Already twisted by evil, people choose their own mad course, for they have no hope. There is nothing ahead but death anyway.4There is hope only for the living. As they say, 'It's better to be a live dog than a dead lion!'5The living at least know they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, nor are they remembered.6Whatever they did in their lifetime-loving, hating, envying-is all long gone. They no longer play a part in anything here on earth.7So go ahead. Eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this!8Wear fine clothes, with a splash of cologne!9Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil.10Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.11I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn't always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn't always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don't always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.12People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy.Thoughts on Wisdom and Folly13Here is another bit of wisdom that has impressed me as I have watched the way our world works.14There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it.15A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterward no one thought to thank him.16So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.17Better to hear the quiet words of a wise personthan the shouts of a foolish king.than the shouts of a foolish king.18Better to have wisdom than weapons of war,but one sinner can destroy much that is good.but one sinner can destroy much that is good.As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks or bad.Hebrew to Sheol."

        "2": "Made Alive with Christ2Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins.22You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil-the commander of the powers in the unseen world. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God.3All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God's anger, just like everyone else.4But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much,5that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God's grace that you have been saved!)6For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus.7So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus.8God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God.9Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.10For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.Oneness and Peace in Christ11Don't forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders. You were called 'uncircumcised heathens' by the Jews, who were proud of their circumcision, even though it affected only their bodies and not their hearts.12In those days you were living apart from Christ. You were excluded from citizenship among the people of Israel, and you did not know the covenant promises God had made to them. You lived in this world without God and without hope.13But now you have been united with Christ Jesus. Once you were far away from God, but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ.14For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us.15He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations. He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups.16Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.17He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him, and peace to the Jews who were near.18Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us.A Temple for the Lord19So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens along with all of God's holy people. You are members of God's family.20Together, we are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself.21We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.22Through him you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit.Greek obeying the commander of the power of the air."

He sent it to King Ben-hadad of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus, along with this message:Lord3'Let there be a treaty between you and me like the one between your father and my father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone.'4Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa's request and sent the commanders of his army to attack the towns of Israel. They conquered the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all the store cities in Naphtali.5As soon as Baasha of Israel heard what was happening, he abandoned his project of fortifying Ramah and stopped all work on it.6Then King Asa called out all the men of Judah to carry away the building stones and timbers that Baasha had been using to fortify Ramah. Asa used these materials to fortify the towns of Geba and Mizpah.7At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa and told him, 'Because you have put your trust in the king of Aram instead of in the Lord your God, you missed your chance to destroy the army of the king of Aram.Lord8Don't you remember what happened to the Ethiopians and Libyans and their vast army, with all of their chariots and charioteers?

What a fool you have been! From now on you will be at war.'Lord10Asa became so angry with Hanani for saying this that he threw him into prison and put him in stocks. At that time Asa also began to oppress some of his people.Summary of Asa's Reign11The rest of the events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.12In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a serious foot disease. Yet even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the Lord's help but turned only to his physicians.Lord13So he died in the forty-first year of his reign.14He was buried in the tomb he had carved out for himself in the City of David.

He set up the seven lamps so they reflected their light forward, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.Lord4The entire lampstand, from its base to its decorative blossoms, was made of beaten gold. It was built according to the exact design the Lord had shown Moses.LordThe Levites Dedicated5Then the Lord said to Moses,Lord6'Now set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel and make them ceremonially clean.7Do this by sprinkling them with the water of purification, and have them shave their entire body and wash their clothing. Then they will be ceremonially clean.8Have them bring a young bull and a grain offering of choice flour moistened with olive oil, along with a second young bull for a sin offering.9Then assemble the whole community of Israel, and present the Levites at the entrance of the Tabernacle.10When you present the Levites before the Lord, the people of Israel must lay their hands on them.Lord11Raising his hands, Aaron must then present the Levites to the Lord as a special offering from the people of Israel, thus dedicating them to the Lord's service.LordLord12'Next the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls. Present one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to purify the Levites and make them right with the Lord.LordLord13Then have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and raise your hands and present them as a special offering to the Lord.Lord14In this way, you will set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel, and the Levites will belong to me.15After this, they may go into the Tabernacle to do their work, because you have purified them and presented them as a special offering.16'Of all the people of Israel, the Levites are reserved for me. I have claimed them for myself in place of all the firstborn sons of the Israelites; I have taken the Levites as their substitutes.17For all the firstborn males among the people of Israel are mine, both of people and of animals. I set them apart for myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians.18Yes, I have claimed the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons of Israel.19And of all the Israelites, I have assigned the Levites to Aaron and his sons.

        "9": "Old Rules about Worship9That first covenant between God and Israel had regulations for worship and a place of worship here on earth.92There were two rooms in that Tabernacle. In the first room were a lampstand, a table, and sacred loaves of bread on the table. This room was called the Holy Place.3Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was the second room called the Most Holy Place.4In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron's staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant.5Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark's cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now.6When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room as they performed their religious duties.7But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.8By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle and the system it represented were still in use.9This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them.10For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies-physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.Christ Is the Perfect Sacrifice11So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come. He has entered that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven, which was not made by human hands and is not part of this created world.12With his own blood-not the blood of goats and calves-he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.13Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer could cleanse people's bodies from ceremonial impurity.14Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins.15That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.16Now when someone leaves a will, it is necessary to prove that the person who made it is dead.17The will goes into effect only after the person's death. While the person who made it is still alive, the will cannot be put into effect.18That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal.19For after Moses had read each of God's commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God's law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool.20Then he said, 'This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.'21And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship.22In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.23That is why the Tabernacle and everything in it, which were copies of things in heaven, had to be purified by the blood of animals. But the real things in heaven had to be purified with far better sacrifices than the blood of animals.24For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with human hands, which was only a copy of the true one in heaven. He entered into heaven itself to appear now before God on our behalf.25And he did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the high priest here on earth who enters the Most Holy Place year after year with the blood of an animal.26If that had been necessary, Christ would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began. But now, once for all time, he has appeared at the end of the age to remove sin by his own death as a sacrifice.27And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment,28so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.Or tent; also in , .Greek second tent.Greek first tent.Or the first room; Greek reads the first tent.Some manuscripts read that are about to come.Greek from dead works.Or covenant; also in .Or Now when someone makes a covenant, it is necessary to ratify it with the death of a sacrifice.Some manuscripts do not include and goats..Greek the ages."

    "Esther": {
        "9": "The Victory of the Jews9So on March 7 the two decrees of the king were put into effect. On that day, the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but quite the opposite happened. It was the Jews who overpowered their enemies.92The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king's provinces to attack anyone who tried to harm them. But no one could make a stand against them, for everyone was afraid of them.3And all the nobles of the provinces, the highest officers, the governors, and the royal officials helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai.4For Mordecai had been promoted in the king's palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as he became more and more powerful.5So the Jews went ahead on the appointed day and struck down their enemies with the sword. They killed and annihilated their enemies and did as they pleased with those who hated them.6In the fortress of Susa itself, the Jews killed 500 men.7They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,8Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,9Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha-10the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not take any plunder.11That very day, when the king was informed of the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa,12he called for Queen Esther. He said, 'The Jews have killed 500 men in the fortress of Susa alone, as well as Haman's ten sons. If they have done that here, what has happened in the rest of the provinces? But now, what more do you want? It will be granted to you; tell me and I will do it.'13Esther responded, 'If it please the king, give the Jews in Susa permission to do again tomorrow as they have done today, and let the bodies of Haman's ten sons be impaled on a pole.'14So the king agreed, and the decree was announced in Susa. And they impaled the bodies of Haman's ten sons.15Then the Jews at Susa gathered together on March 8 and killed 300 more men, and again they took no plunder.16Meanwhile, the other Jews throughout the king's provinces had gathered together to defend their lives. They gained relief from all their enemies, killing 75,000 of those who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.17This was done throughout the provinces on March 7, and on March 8 they rested, celebrating their victory with a day of feasting and gladness.18(The Jews at Susa killed their enemies on March 7 and again on March 8, then rested on March 9, making that their day of feasting and gladness.)19So to this day, rural Jews living in remote villages celebrate an annual festival and holiday on the appointed day in late winter, when they rejoice and send gifts of food to each other.The Festival of Purim20Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to the Jews near and far, throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes,21calling on them to celebrate an annual festival on these two days.22He told them to celebrate these days with feasting and gladness and by giving gifts of food to each other and presents to the poor. This would commemorate a time when the Jews gained relief from their enemies, when their sorrow was turned into gladness and their mourning into joy.23So the Jews accepted Mordecai's proposal and adopted this annual custom.24Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had plotted to crush and destroy them on the date determined by casting lots (the lots were called purim).25But when Esther came before the king, he issued a decree causing Haman's evil plot to backfire, and Haman and his sons were impaled on a sharpened pole.26That is why this celebration is called Purim, because it is the ancient word for casting lots.So because of Mordecai's letter and because of what they had experienced,27the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews. They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year.28These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire. This Festival of Purim would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews, nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants.29Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote another letter putting the queen's full authority behind Mordecai's letter to establish the Festival of Purim.30Letters wishing peace and security were sent to the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of the empire of Xerxes.31These letters established the Festival of Purim-an annual celebration of these days at the appointed time, decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther. (The people decided to observe this festival, just as they had decided for themselves and their descendants to establish the times of fasting and mourning.)32So the command of Esther confirmed the practices of Purim, and it was all written down in the records.Hebrew on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.

    "Galatians": {
        "3": "The Law and Faith in Christ3Oh, foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning of Jesus Christ's death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross.32Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of course not! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ.3How foolish can you be? After starting your new lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?4Have you experienced so much for nothing? Surely it was not in vain, was it?5I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ.6In the same way, 'Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.'7The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God.8What's more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would make the Gentiles right in his sight because of their faith. God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, 'All nations will be blessed through you.'9So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.10But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, 'Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God's Book of the Law.'11So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, 'It is through faith that a righteous person has life.'12This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, 'It is through obeying the law that a person has life.'13But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'14Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith.The Law and God's Promise15Dear brothers and sisters, here's an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement, so it is in this case.16God gave the promises to Abraham and his child. And notice that the Scripture doesn't say 'to his children,' as if it meant many descendants. Rather, it says 'to his child'-and that, of course, means Christ.17This is what I am trying to say: The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses. God would be breaking his promise.18For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God's promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise.19Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.20Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham.21Is there a conflict, then, between God's law and God's promises? Absolutely not! If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it.22But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God's promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ.God's Children through Faith23Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.24Let me put it another way.

        "6": "Seven Men Chosen to Serve6But as the believers rapidly multiplied, there were rumblings of discontent. The Greek-speaking believers complained about the Hebrew-speaking believers, saying that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food.62So the Twelve called a meeting of all the believers. They said, 'We apostles should spend our time teaching the word of God, not running a food program.3And so, brothers, select seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will give them this responsibility.4Then we apostles can spend our time in prayer and teaching the word.'5Everyone liked this idea, and they chose the following: Stephen (a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas of Antioch (an earlier convert to the Jewish faith).6These seven were presented to the apostles, who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them.7So God's message continued to spread. The number of believers greatly increased in Jerusalem, and many of the Jewish priests were converted, too.Stephen Is Arrested8Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, performed amazing miracles and signs among the people.9But one day some men from the Synagogue of Freed Slaves, as it was called, started to debate with him. They were Jews from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and the province of Asia.10None of them could stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke.11So they persuaded some men to lie about Stephen, saying, 'We heard him blaspheme Moses, and even God.'12This roused the people, the elders, and the teachers of religious law. So they arrested Stephen and brought him before the high council.13The lying witnesses said, 'This man is always speaking against the holy Temple and against the law of Moses.14We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the Temple and change the customs Moses handed down to us.'15At this point everyone in the high council stared at Stephen, because his face became as bright as an angel's.Greek disciples; also in , .Greek Sanhedrin; also in .Or Jesus the Nazarene."

        "7": "Instruction on Marriage7Now regarding the questions you asked in your letter. Yes, it is good to abstain from sexual relations.72But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.3The husband should fulfill his wife's sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband's needs.4The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.5Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.6I say this as a concession, not as a command.7But I wish everyone were single, just as I am. Yet each person has a special gift from God, of one kind or another.8So I say to those who aren't married and to widows-it's better to stay unmarried, just as I am.9But if they can't control themselves, they should go ahead and marry. It's better to marry than to burn with lust.10But for those who are married, I have a command that comes not from me, but from the Lord. A wife must not leave her husband.11But if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be reconciled to him. And the husband must not leave his wife.12Now, I will speak to the rest of you, though I do not have a direct command from the Lord. If a fellow believer has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to continue living with him, he must not leave her.13And if a believing woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to continue living with her, she must not leave him.14For the believing wife brings holiness to her marriage, and the believing husband brings holiness to his marriage. Otherwise, your children would not be holy, but now they are holy.15(But if the husband or wife who isn't a believer insists on leaving, let them go. In such cases the believing husband or wife is no longer bound to the other, for God has called you to live in peace.)16Don't you wives realize that your husbands might be saved because of you? And don't you husbands realize that your wives might be saved because of you?17Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you, and remain as you were when God first called you. This is my rule for all the churches.18For instance, a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it. And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now.19For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God's commandments.20Yes, each of you should remain as you were when God called you.21Are you a slave? Don't let that worry you-but if you get a chance to be free, take it.22And remember, if you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free in the Lord. And if you were free when the Lord called you, you are now a slave of Christ.23God paid a high price for you, so don't be enslaved by the world.24Each of you, dear brothers and sisters, should remain as you were when God first called you.25Now regarding your question about the young women who are not yet married. I do not have a command from the Lord for them. But the Lord in his mercy has given me wisdom that can be trusted, and I will share it with you.26Because of the present crisis, I think it is best to remain as you are.27If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage. If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married.28But if you do get married, it is not a sin. And if a young woman gets married, it is not a sin. However, those who get married at this time will have troubles, and I am trying to spare you those problems.29But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage.30Those who weep or who rejoice or who buy things should not be absorbed by their weeping or their joy or their possessions.31Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them. For this world as we know it will soon pass away.32I want you to be free from the concerns of this life. An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord's work and thinking how to please him.33But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife.34His interests are divided. In the same way, a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit. But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband.35I am saying this for your benefit, not to place restrictions on you. I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best, with as few distractions as possible.36But if a man thinks that he's treating his fiance improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin.37But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion, he does well not to marry.38So the person who marries his fiance does well, and the person who doesn't marry does even better.39A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord.40But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single, and I think I am giving you counsel from God's Spirit when I say this.Or to live a celibate life; Greek reads It is good for a man not to touch a woman.See ; ; ; .Greek a brother.Greek the brother.Greek the brother or sister.Some manuscripts read us.Greek don't become slaves of people.Greek brothers; also in .Or the pressures of life.Greek but only in the Lord."

        "3": "The Priceless Value of Knowing Christ3Whatever happens, my dear brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord. I never get tired of telling you these things, and I do it to safeguard your faith.32Watch out for those dogs, those people who do evil, those mutilators who say you must be circumcised to be saved.3For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised. We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort,4though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed, if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!5I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin-a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.6I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.7I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.8Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ9and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ. For God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith.10I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death,11so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead!Pressing toward the Goal12I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me.13No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead,14I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.15Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things. If you disagree on some point, I believe God will make it plain to you.16But we must hold on to the progress we have already made.17Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from those who follow our example.18For I have told you often before, and I say it again with tears in my eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.19They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag about shameful things, and they think only about this life here on earth.20But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior.21He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control.Greek brothers; also in , .Some manuscripts read worship God in spirit; one early manuscript reads worship in spirit.Or through the faithfulness of Christ.Some manuscripts read not yet achieved it."

Treat him just as you treated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.'Lord3'So the Lord our God handed King Og and all his people over to us, and we killed them all. Not a single person survived.Lord4We conquered all sixty of his towns-the entire Argob region in his kingdom of Bashan. Not a single town escaped our conquest.5These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates. We also took many unwalled villages at the same time.6We completely destroyed the kingdom of Bashan, just as we had destroyed King Sihon of Heshbon. We destroyed all the people in every town we conquered-men, women, and children alike.7But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the towns.8'So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River-all the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon.9(Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it Senir.)10We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.11(King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites.

It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.)Land Division East of the Jordan12'When we took possession of this land, I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge, plus half of the hill country of Gilead with its towns.13Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan-Og's former kingdom-to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known as the land of the Rephaites.14Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the whole Argob region in Bashan, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. Jair renamed this region after himself, calling it the Towns of Jair, as it is still known today.)15I gave Gilead to the clan of Makir.16But I also gave part of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The area I gave them extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge in the south to the Jabbok River on the Ammonite frontier.17They also received the Jordan Valley, all the way from the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea, with the Jordan River serving as the western boundary. To the east were the slopes of Pisgah.18'At that time I gave this command to the tribes that would live east of the Jordan: 'Although the Lord your God has given you this land as your property, all your fighting men must cross the Jordan ahead of your Israelite relatives, armed and ready to assist them.Lord19Your wives, children, and numerous livestock, however, may stay behind in the towns I have given you.20When the Lord has given security to the rest of the Israelites, as he has to you, and when they occupy the land the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan River, then you may all return here to the land I have given you.'LordLordMoses Forbidden to Enter the Land21'At that time I gave Joshua this charge: 'You have seen for yourself everything the Lord your God has done to these two kings. He will do the same to all the kingdoms on the west side of the Jordan.Lord22Do not be afraid of the nations there, for the Lord your God will fight for you.'Lord23'At that time I pleaded with the Lord and said,Lord24'O Sovereign Lord, you have only begun to show your greatness and the strength of your hand to me, your servant. Is there any god in heaven or on earth who can perform such great and mighty deeds as you do?Lord25Please let me cross the Jordan to see the wonderful land on the other side, the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon mountains.'26'But the Lord was angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me. 'That's enough!' he declared. 'Speak of it no more.Lord27But go up to Pisgah Peak, and look over the land in every direction. Take a good look, but you may not cross the Jordan River.28Instead, commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead the people across the Jordan.

They must allow him to enter the city and give him a place to live among them.5If the relatives of the victim come to avenge the killing, the leaders must not release the slayer to them, for he killed the other person unintentionally and without previous hostility.6But the slayer must stay in that city and be tried by the local assembly, which will render a judgment. And he must continue to live in that city until the death of the high priest who was in office at the time of the accident. After that, he is free to return to his own home in the town from which he fled.'7The following cities were designated as cities of refuge: Kedesh of Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali; Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim; and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah.8On the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho, the following cities were designated: Bezer, in the wilderness plain of the tribe of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead, in the territory of the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan, in the land of the tribe of Manasseh.9These cities were set apart for all the Israelites as well as the foreigners living among them.

        "4": "Live to Please God4Finally, dear brothers and sisters, we urge you in the name of the Lord Jesus to live in a way that pleases God, as we have taught you. You live this way already, and we encourage you to do so even more.42For you remember what we taught you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.3God's will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all sexual sin.4Then each of you will control his own body and live in holiness and honor-5not in lustful passion like the pagans who do not know God and his ways.6Never harm or cheat a fellow believer in this matter by violating his wife, for the Lord avenges all such sins, as we have solemnly warned you before.7God has called us to live holy lives, not impure lives.8Therefore, anyone who refuses to live by these rules is not disobeying human teaching but is rejecting God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.9But we don't need to write to you about the importance of loving each other, for God himself has taught you to love one another.10Indeed, you already show your love for all the believers throughout Macedonia. Even so, dear brothers and sisters, we urge you to love them even more.11Make it your goal to live a quiet life, minding your own business and working with your hands, just as we instructed you before.12Then people who are not believers will respect the way you live, and you will not need to depend on others.The Hope of the Resurrection13And now, dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died so you will not grieve like people who have no hope.14For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again, we also believe that when Jesus returns, God will bring back with him the believers who have died.15We tell you this directly from the Lord: We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet him ahead of those who have died.16For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the believers who have died will rise from their graves.17Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever.18So encourage each other with these words.Greek brothers; also in , .Or will know how to take a wife for himself; or will learn to live with his own wife; Greek reads will know how to possess his own vessel.Greek Never harm or cheat a brother in this matter.Greek about brotherly love.Greek the brothers.Greek those who have fallen asleep; also in .Greek those who have fallen asleep.Greek the dead in Christ."

If he healed the man's hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.8But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, 'Come and stand in front of everyone.' So the man came forward.'Come and stand in front of everyone.'9Then Jesus said to his critics, 'I have a question for you.

There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon.18They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil spirits were healed.19Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone.The Beatitudes20Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said,'God blesses you who are poor,'God blesses you who are poor,for the Kingdom of God is yours.for the Kingdom of God is yours.for the Kingdom of God is yours.21God blesses you who are hungry now,God blesses you who are hungry now,for you will be satisfied.for you will be satisfied.for you will be satisfied.God blesses you who weep now,God blesses you who weep now,for in due time you will laugh.for in due time you will laugh.for in due time you will laugh.22What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man.What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man.23When that happens, be happy!

He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life.9He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.10For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation.11They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching. And they do it only for money.12Even one of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said about them, 'The people of Crete are all liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons.'13This is true. So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith.14They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth.15Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure.

Refusing to accept God's way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law.4For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God.Salvation Is for Everyone5For Moses writes that the law's way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands.6But faith's way of getting right with God says, 'Don't say in your heart, 'Who will go up to heaven?' (to bring Christ down to earth).7And don't say, 'Who will go down to the place of the dead?' (to bring Christ back to life again).'8In fact, it says,'The message is very close at hand;it is on your lips and in your heart.'it is on your lips and in your heart.'And that message is the very message about faith that we preach:9If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.10For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved.11As the Scriptures tell us, 'Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.'12Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him.13For 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'Lord14But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them?15And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, 'How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!'16But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'Lord17So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.18But I ask, have the people of Israel actually heard the message? Yes, they have:'The message has gone throughout the earth,and the words to all the world.'and the words to all the world.'19But I ask, did the people of Israel really understand? Yes, they did, for even in the time of Moses, God said,'I will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation.I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles.'I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles.'20And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God, saying,'I was found by people who were not looking for me.I showed myself to those who were not asking for me.'I showed myself to those who were not asking for me.'21But regarding Israel, God said,'All day long I opened my arms to them,but they were disobedient and rebellious.'but they were disobedient and rebellious.'Greek Brothers.Or For Christ is the end of the law.See ..(Greek version).Greek and Greek......(Greek version).(Greek version)."

Then many people will give thanks because God has graciously answered so many prayers for our safety.Paul's Change of Plans12We can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have lived with a God-given holiness and sincerity in all our dealings. We have depended on God's grace, not on our own human wisdom. That is how we have conducted ourselves before the world, and especially toward you.13Our letters have been straightforward, and there is nothing written between the lines and nothing you can't understand. I hope someday you will fully understand us,14even if you don't understand us now. Then on the day when the Lord Jesus returns, you will be proud of us in the same way we are proud of you.15Since I was so sure of your understanding and trust, I wanted to give you a double blessing by visiting you twice-16first on my way to Macedonia and again when I returned from Macedonia. Then you could send me on my way to Judea.17You may be asking why I changed my plan. Do you think I make my plans carelessly? Do you think I am like people of the world who say 'Yes' when they really mean 'No'?18As surely as God is faithful, our word to you does not waver between 'Yes' and 'No.'19For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, does not waver between 'Yes' and 'No.' He is the one whom Silas, Timothy, and I preached to you, and as God's ultimate 'Yes,' he always does what he says.20For all of God's promises have been fulfilled in Christ with a resounding 'Yes!' And through Christ, our 'Amen' (which means 'Yes') ascends to God for his glory.21It is God who enables us, along with you, to stand firm for Christ. He has commissioned us,22and he has identified us as his own by placing the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the first installment that guarantees everything he has promised us.23Now I call upon God as my witness that I am telling the truth. The reason I didn't return to Corinth was to spare you from a severe rebuke.24But that does not mean we want to dominate you by telling you how to put your faith into practice. We want to work together with you so you will be full of joy, for it is by your own faith that you stand firm.Greek Achaia, the southern region of the Greek peninsula.Greek brothers.Some manuscripts read honesty.Some manuscripts read our Lord Jesus.Macedonia was in the northern region of Greece.Greek Silvanus."

        "1": "Greetings from Peter1This letter is from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.1I am writing to God's chosen people who are living as foreigners in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.2God the Father knew you and chose you long ago, and his Spirit has made you holy. As a result, you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ.May God give you more and more grace and peace.The Hope of Eternal Life3All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Now we live with great expectation,4and we have a priceless inheritance-an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.5And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see.6So be truly glad. There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while.7These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold-though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.8You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy.9The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls.10This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when they prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you.11They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ's suffering and his great glory afterward.12They were told that their messages were not for themselves, but for you. And now this Good News has been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. It is all so wonderful that even the angels are eagerly watching these things happen.A Call to Holy Living13So prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control. Put all your hope in the gracious salvation that will come to you when Jesus Christ is revealed to the world.14So you must live as God's obedient children. Don't slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires. You didn't know any better then.15But now you must be holy in everything you do, just as God who chose you is holy.16For the Scriptures say, 'You must be holy because I am holy.'17And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has no favorites. He will judge or reward you according to what you do. So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time here as 'temporary residents.'18For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value.19It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God.20God chose him as your ransom long before the world began, but now in these last days he has been revealed for your sake.21Through Christ you have come to trust in God. And you have placed your faith and hope in God because he raised Christ from the dead and gave him great glory.22You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters. Love each other deeply with all your heart.23For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God.24As the Scriptures say,'People are like grass;their beauty is like a flower in the field.their beauty is like a flower in the field.The grass withers and the flower fades.25But the word of the Lord remains forever.'25But the word of the Lord remains forever.'And that word is the Good News that was preached to you.Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia were Roman provinces in what is now Turkey.Or So you are truly glad.; ; .Greek must have brotherly love.Some manuscripts read with a pure heart.."

You are eager to turn back from destroying people.LordLord3Just kill me now, Lord!

This eased his discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant.Lord7But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away.8And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die.

How, in comparison, does it look to you now? It must seem like nothing at all!4But now the Lord says: Be strong, Zerubbabel. Be strong, Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

Ask the priests this question about the law:Lord12'If one of you is carrying some meat from a holy sacrifice in his robes and his robe happens to brush against some bread or stew, wine or olive oil, or any other kind of food, will it also become holy?''The priests replied, 'No.'13Then Haggai asked, 'If someone becomes ceremonially unclean by touching a dead person and then touches any of these foods, will the food be defiled?'And the priests answered, 'Yes.'14Then Haggai responded, 'That is how it is with this people and this nation, says the Lord. Everything they do and everything they offer is defiled by their sin.Lord15Look at what was happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of the Lord's Temple.Lord16When you hoped for a twenty-bushel crop, you harvested only ten.

These things only lead to meaningless speculations, which don't help people live a life of faith in God.5The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.6But some people have missed this whole point. They have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions.7They want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses, but they don't know what they are talking about, even though they speak so confidently.8We know that the law is good when used correctly.9For the law was not intended for people who do what is right. It is for people who are lawless and rebellious, who are ungodly and sinful, who consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy, who kill their father or mother or commit other murders.10The law is for people who are sexually immoral, or who practice homosexuality, or are slave traders, liars, promise breakers, or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome teaching11that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God.Paul's Gratitude for God's Mercy12I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength to do his work. He considered me trustworthy and appointed me to serve him,13even though I used to blaspheme the name of Christ. In my insolence, I persecuted his people. But God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance and unbelief.14Oh, how generous and gracious our Lord was! He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus.15This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it: 'Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners'-and I am the worst of them all.16But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life.17All honor and glory to God forever and ever! He is the eternal King, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is God. Amen.Timothy's Responsibility18Timothy, my son, here are my instructions for you, based on the prophetic words spoken about you earlier. May they help you fight well in the Lord's battles.19Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.20Hymenaeus and Alexander are two examples.

From before the times of our ancestors, everything has remained the same since the world was first created.'5They deliberately forget that God made the heavens long ago by the word of his command, and he brought the earth out from the water and surrounded it with water.6Then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood.7And by the same word, the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire. They are being kept for the day of judgment, when ungodly people will be destroyed.8But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day.9The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.10But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment.11Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live,12looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames.13But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.14And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.15And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved. This is what our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him-16speaking of these things in all of his letters. Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.Peter's Final Words17You already know these things, dear friends. So be on guard; then you will not be carried away by the errors of these wicked people and lose your own secure footing.18Rather, you must grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.All glory to him, both now and forever!

Just then the family redeemer he had mentioned came by, so Boaz called out to him, 'Come over here and sit down, friend. I want to talk to you.' So they sat down together.42Then Boaz called ten leaders from the town and asked them to sit as witnesses.3And Boaz said to the family redeemer, 'You know Naomi, who came back from Moab. She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.4I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem it if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here in the presence of these witnesses. But if you don't want it, let me know right away, because I am next in line to redeem it after you.'The man replied, 'All right, I'll redeem it.'5Then Boaz told him, 'Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow. That way she can have children who will carry on her husband's name and keep the land in the family.'6'Then I can't redeem it,' the family redeemer replied, 'because this might endanger my own estate. You redeem the land; I cannot do it.'7Now in those days it was the custom in Israel for anyone transferring a right of purchase to remove his sandal and hand it to the other party. This publicly validated the transaction.8So the other family redeemer drew off his sandal as he said to Boaz, 'You buy the land.'9Then Boaz said to the elders and to the crowd standing around, 'You are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.10And with the land I have acquired Ruth, the Moabite widow of Mahlon, to be my wife. This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. You are all witnesses today.'11Then the elders and all the people standing in the gate replied, 'We are witnesses! May the Lord make this woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, from whom all the nation of Israel descended! May you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.Lord12And may the Lord give you descendants by this young woman who will be like those of our ancestor Perez, the son of Tamar and Judah.'LordThe Descendants of Boaz13So Boaz took Ruth into his home, and she became his wife.

May this child be famous in Israel.Lord15May he restore your youth and care for you in your old age. For he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you and has been better to you than seven sons!'16Naomi took the baby and cuddled him to her breast. And she cared for him as if he were her own.17The neighbor women said, 'Now at last Naomi has a son again!' And they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse and the grandfather of David.18This is the genealogical record of their ancestor Perez:Perez was the father of Hezron.19Hezron was the father of Ram.Ram was the father of Amminadab.20Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.Nahshon was the father of Salmon.21Salmon was the father of Boaz.Boaz was the father of Obed.22Obed was the father of Jesse.Jesse was the father of David.As in some Greek manuscripts (see also ); Hebrew reads Salma."

Now he will mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.17So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.18If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me.19I, PAUL, WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND: I WILL REPAY IT. AND I WON'T MENTION THAT YOU OWE ME YOUR VERY SOUL!I, PAUL, WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND: I WILL REPAY IT. AND I WON'T MENTION THAT YOU OWE ME YOUR VERY SOUL20Yes, my brother, please do me this favor for the Lord's sake. Give me this encouragement in Christ.21I am confident as I write this letter that you will do what I ask and even more!22One more thing-please prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that God will answer your prayers and let me return to you soon.Paul's Final Greetings23Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings.24So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers.25May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.Throughout this letter, you and your are singular except in verses 3, 22, and 25.Or a prisoner of Christ Jesus.Onesimus means 'useful.'Greek onaimen, a play on the name Onesimus."

    "Jude.tx": {
        "": "Greetings from Jude1This letter is from Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.I am writing to all who have been called by God the Father, who loves you and keeps you safe in the care of Jesus Christ.2May God give you more and more mercy, peace, and love.The Danger of False Teachers3Dear friends, I had been eagerly planning to write to you about the salvation we all share. But now I find that I must write about something else, urging you to defend the faith that God has entrusted once for all time to his holy people.4I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches, saying that God's marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives. The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago, for they have denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.5So I want to remind you, though you already know these things, that Jesus first rescued the nation of Israel from Egypt, but later he destroyed those who did not remain faithful.6And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the great day of judgment.7And don't forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God's judgment.8In the same way, these people-who claim authority from their dreams-live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings.9But even Michael, one of the mightiest of the angels, did not dare accuse the devil of blasphemy, but simply said, 'The Lord rebuke you!' (This took place when Michael was arguing with the devil about Moses' body.)10But these people scoff at things they do not understand. Like unthinking animals, they do whatever their instincts tell them, and so they bring about their own destruction.11What sorrow awaits them! For they follow in the footsteps of Cain, who killed his brother. Like Balaam, they deceive people for money. And like Korah, they perish in their rebellion.12When these people eat with you in your fellowship meals commemorating the Lord's love, they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you. They are like shameless shepherds who care only for themselves. They are like clouds blowing over the land without giving any rain. They are like trees in autumn that are doubly dead, for they bear no fruit and have been pulled up by the roots.13They are like wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their shameful deeds. They are like wandering stars, doomed forever to blackest darkness.14Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, 'Listen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones15to execute judgment on the people of the world. He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'16These people are grumblers and complainers, living only to satisfy their desires. They brag loudly about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.A Call to Remain Faithful17But you, my dear friends, must remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ predicted.18They told you that in the last times there would be scoffers whose purpose in life is to satisfy their ungodly desires.19These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God's Spirit in them.20But you, dear friends, must build each other up in your most holy faith, pray in the power of the Holy Spirit,21and await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will bring you eternal life. In this way, you will keep yourselves safe in God's love.22And you must show mercy to those whose faith is wavering.23Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment. Show mercy to still others, but do so with great caution, hating the sins that contaminate their lives.A Prayer of Praise24Now all glory to God, who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault.25All glory to him who alone is God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord. All glory, majesty, power, and authority are his before all time, and in the present, and beyond all time! Amen.Or keeps you for Jesus Christ.Other manuscripts read [the] Lord, or God, or God Christ.Greek at glorious ones, which are probably evil angels.Greek Michael, the archangel.Or they are contaminants among you; or they are stains.The quotation comes from intertestamental literature: Enoch 1:9.Greek pray in the Holy Spirit.Some manuscripts read must reprove.Some manuscripts have only two categories of people: (1) those whose faith is wavering and therefore need to be snatched from the flames of judgment, and (2) those who need to be shown mercy.Greek with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh."
